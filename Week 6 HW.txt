The main difference in working with HTTP vs console input/output is that console rely on string inputs 
and outputs while HTTP must handle routing, response types, and states.

The main challenge I faced was in testing. Since I updated AssignmentService to take two injected
 dependencies, my tests needed to be updated with the proper constructor and mocks.

By separating responsibilities, classes become more cohesive and less reliant on things that they do not need.
